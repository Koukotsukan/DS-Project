## Handbook

### Entrance Class

`DS-Project -> project_sociopath -> src -> com -> sociopath -> ui -> MainInterface`

### Possible Problems and Solution

If you are having an IOException, that is probably because your IDE cannot find `path.properties`.
The simplest fix method is to go to `DS-Project -> project_sociopath -> src -> com -> sociopath -> util -> PathUtils`, change line 21 "path.properties" to the absolute path of 'DS-Project/path.properties'
